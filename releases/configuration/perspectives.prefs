#Â Perspective selector with only icons
org.eclipse.ui/SHOW_TEXT_ON_PERSPECTIVE_BAR=false

# Default perspective is Java
org.eclipse.ui/defaultPerspectiveId=org.eclipse.jdt.ui.JavaPerspective

# Would be great to be able to:
# * override the default layout of perspectives here
# * override the default perspective buttons
# ... like we used to do, but it doesn't seem to work anymore
